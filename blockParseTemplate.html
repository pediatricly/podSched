            <details><summary>How does El Nino work?</summary>
            <p>El Nino reads the messy schedule data on the Amion website and turns it into something only a robot could love - beautifully elaborate, machine-readable data on the entire residency program's schedule. This has some great uses:
                <ul><li>lunchMoney
                        <ul><li>Tally up how much cash to put on meal cards based on their rotation week-by-week.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>confAttend
                        <ul><li>Get the "denominator" for conference attendence. Count up how many conferences residents should have attended based on their block schedules.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>podSched
                        <ul><li>Getting multiple residents on different schedules in the same place at the same time is a pain!</li>
                            <li>podSched goes through an arbitrary subset of residents' schedules and outputs a ranked, scored list of dates when they are on the most aligned and convenient rotations.</li>
                            <li>For example, if you want to schedule an evening meeting, you can score for shifts that end around 5pm to pick an evening when everyone is available. (Hence the name - this was developed to schedule PLUS pod dinners.)</li>                           </ul></li></ul></p>
            <p>BUT, to do any of this, you need to make sure El Nino is working with an updated schedule. We all know the Amion schedule changes frequently. And that's why you are here.</p></details>

<main>
<h2>Congratulations! You have just updated El Nino's database!</h2>
<!--Main output files from blockParse are linked here.-->
<div class="output" id="outputLinks">
<p>This should have updated these main output files: 
    <ul><li><a href="http://pediatricly.com/cgi-bin/elNino/allResPrinter.py">$outfile</a>
        <ul><li>NB for superusers: These links are actually to other Python CGI scripts that just prints the data file. You can't directly download the file for security reasons.</li>
            <li>Contains the main data, all resident schedules and block dates, as a Python file.</li>
            <li>You'll probably never look at this but nice to know it's there. (And to have it for debugging.)</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li><a href="http://pediatricly.com/cgi-bin/elNino/CoCprinter.py">$CoC</a>
            <ul><li>Simple spreadsheet (csv) of all the residents' Amion names with their continuity clinic day as listed in Amion. (NB: Will have weird/missing output for chiefs and super-seniors.)</li>
                <li>Very useful for the schedule template spreadsheets.</li></ul></li>
        <li><a href="http://pediatricly.com/cgi-bin/elNino/allRotsPrinter.py">$allRots</a>
            <ul><li>Even simpler csv, just a list of all the rotations in this year's block schedule across all years.</li>
                <li>Very useful for the other El Nino functions where you'll need scores or expected values for each rotation.</li></ul></li></ul>
</p></div>

<!--Summary Stats Printed Here-->
<div class="output" id="summaryStats">
<p>Here are some summary stats for sanity checking. El Nino scraped data on:
    <ul><li>$totalRots rotations in total. Typical is very roughly 1500.</li>   
        <li>$totRes residents in total. Typical is about 90.
            <ul><li>R3s: $R3str</li>
                <li>R2s: $R2str</li>
                <li>R1s: $R1str</li></ul></li>
        <li>Your new date is $updated (yyyy-mm-dd).</li>
        <li>Your block 1 split dates are:
            <ul><li>$block1split1 for R1s</li>
                <li>$block1split23 for R2s and R3s</li></ul></li></ul>
