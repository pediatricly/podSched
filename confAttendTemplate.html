<p>Email Mike if you need to change those. Note that you'll need to store old data before changing conference times as El Nino re-calculates minutes late with every run.</p>

<h4>Check for errors!</h4>
    <p>Any residents with missing data are printed in the table below.</p>
        <ul><li>This is normal for super-seniors (+ chiefs), but they should be filtered out of this list.
            <ul><li>Tell Mike if super-seniors are in the table.</li></ul></li>
            <li>If normal-schedule residents are listed here:
                <ul><li>Most likely, they're on a new rotation. (Or an old rotation with a new name in Amion - to El Nino, "Purple1" and "purple 1" are completely different rotations.):</li>
                    <ul><li>You'll need to define the weekly number of AM and noon conferences expected for this new rotation. Email those to Mike.</li></ul>
                    <li>But, if that doesn't fix it, there may be a problem with how El Nino is reading their schedule. 
                        <ul><li>These often show up as names without block numbers or rotation names because El Nino couldn't figure out either.</li>
                            <li>El Nino can only read full-week rotations. Rarely, residents may have shorter rotations esp in Block 1 or 13. Double check any of these manually.</li>
                            <li>If none of those explain it, tell Mike.</li></ul></li></ul>                 </li></ul> 
    <table>$errRotStr</table>

    <p>Any badge numbers El Nino does not recognize are in the table below. Obviously broken numbers are just bad scans. Numbers that look like 16-digits could be confused sub-Is or could be a problem with your badge list.</p>

<h4>Badge Log Files Used:</h4>
    <p>This will accumulate every badge log csv file you've ever uploaded. This is by design - El Nino removes duplicates so you don't have to worry about clearing the log on your iPhone. El Nino automatically renames these files by the date uploaded. To remove old files (say, at start of year), email Mike.</p>
