<h3 class="title">The El Nino Main Page</h2>
<p class="intro">El Nino is a system of <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> programs developed by <a href="http://lnkd.in/sCnSZw">Mike Scahill</a> in Jan-Feb 2016 to help with administrative tasks for the UCSF Pediatrics Residency. It turns the residency schedule from the Amion site into a machine readable format to perform its functions.</p>

<p>The source code is open and freely available. Contact <a href="http://lnkd.in/sCnSZw">Mike</a> for further details.</p>

They are freely available and intended for guidance only. All results should be checked and no action taken based only on these results. Likewise, El Nino will of course be inaccurate if any user input does not work correctly. The program tries to warn when this may occur but no responsibility for any errors that may result is completely the user's. Use of El Nino implies understanding and agreement with all statements on this page.</p>

<p class="fine">This disclaimer is especially important because El Nino has not been thoroughly tested. There may be further problems in addition to these <strong>known issues</strong>: 
    <ul id="issues"><li>El Nino reads the Amion website but does not communicate with it. Amion may change its format at any time and so break El Nino's ability to read it. This would render all of El Nino's data inaccurate.</li>
        <li>El Nino expects all rotations to be at least 1 week long. In rare instances when this is not true, El Nino produces small inaccuracies.</li>
        <li>Accordingly, El Nino rounds the first week of block 1 and the last week of block 13 up to full weeks for lunch money allocation so residents are not short changed. (Caveat - see next item.)</li>
        <li>El Nino assumes the last block of the year (block 13 as of 2015-6) is roughly a full 28 day block even though it is not. This may cause minor inaccuracies with dates and allocations. Block 1 and 13 should always be double-checked for accuracy.</li>
        <li>El Nino lives on servers not in Pacific time zone. This may cause minor discrepancies with update dates and search dates.</li></ul></p>
