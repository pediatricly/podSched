<h3>But first, check for 2 errors!</h3>
    <p>Error - Residents with Missing Rotation Data</p>
        <ul><li>This is normal for super-seniors (which often include chiefs). They will always be on this list.</li>
            <li>But if normal-schedule resident are listed here:
                <ul><li>Most likely, they're on a new rotation - see below.</li>
                    <li>But, if that doesn't fix it, there may be a problem with how El Nino is reading their schedule.
                        <ul><li>El Nino can only read full-week rotations. Rarely, residents may have shorter rotations esp in Block 1 or 13. Double check any of these manually.</li>
                            <li>If none of those explain it, tell Mike.</li></ul></li></ul>                 </li></ul>

    <p>Error - Rotations Missing Money Data</p>
                <ul><li>New / unusual rotations may show up here because El Nino does not know how much money they should be assigned.</li>
                    <li>This is common and easy to fix - go back to the <a href="http://pediatricly.com/cgi-bin/elNino/lunchMoneyForm.py">entry form</a> and upload a new version of <a href="http://pediatricly.com/cgi-bin/elNino/foodCashByWeekPrinter.py" target="_blank">$rotCashcsv</a> with the new rotations in new rows at the bottom. 
                        <ul><li>Remember, these must be entered in the csv <i>exactly</i> the way they are spelled here. Spacing, capitalization and punctuation must all match perfectly. (To El Nino, "Purple1" and "purple 1" are completely different rotations.)</li></ul></li></ul>
