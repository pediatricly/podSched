             <details><summary>How does El Nino work?</summary>
            <p>El Nino reads the messy schedule data on the Amion website and turns it into something only a robot could love - beautifully elaborate, machine-readable data on the entire residency program's schedule. This has some great uses:
                <ul><li><a href="http://pediatricly.com/cgi-bin/elNino/lunchMoneyForm.py">Lunch Money</a></li>
                        <ul><li>Tally up how much cash to put on meal cards based on their rotation week-by-week.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>confAttend - not available online yet
                        <ul><li>Get the "denominator" for conference attendence. Count up how many conferences residents should have attended based on their block schedules.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li><a href="http://pediatricly.com/cgi-bin/elNino/meetingPlanner.py">Meeting Planner</a>
                        <ul><li>Getting multiple residents on different schedules in the same place at the same time is a pain!</li>
                            <li>Meeting Planner goes through an arbitrary subset of residents' schedules and outputs a ranked, scored list of dates when they are on the most aligned and convenient rotations.</li>
                            <li>For example, if you want to schedule an evening meeting, you can score for shifts that end around 5pm to pick an evening when everyone is available. (Hence the name - this was developed to schedule PLUS pod dinners.)</li>                           </ul></li></ul></p>
            <p>BUT, to do any of this, you need to make sure El Nino is working with an updated schedule. We all know the Amion schedule changes frequently. And that's why it all starts with <a href="http://pediatricly.com/cgi-bin/elNino/updater.py">Updater</a>.</p></details>

<h3>But first, check for 2 errors!</h3>
    <p>Error - Residents with Missing Rotation Data
        <ul><li>This is normal for super-seniors (which often include chiefs). They will always be on this list.</li>
            <li>But if normal-schedule resident are listed here:
                <ul><li>Most likely, they're on a new rotation - see below.</li>
                    <li>But, if that doesn't fix it, there may be a problem with how El Nino is reading their schedule.
                        <ul><li>El Nino can only read full-week rotations. Rarely, residents may have shorter rotations esp in Block 1 or 13. Double check any of these manually.</li>
                            <li>If none of those explain it, tell Mike.</li></ul></li></ul>                 </li></ul>

    <p>Error - Rotations Missing Money Data
                <ul><li>New / unusual rotations may show up here because El Nino does not know how much money they should be assigned.</li>
                    <li>This is common and easy to fix - go back to the <a href="http://pediatricly.com/cgi-bin/elNino/lunchMoneyForm.py">entry form</a> and upload a new version of <a href="http://pediatricly.com/cgi-bin/elNino/foodCashByWeekPrinter.py" target="_blank">foodCashByWeek.csv</a> with the new rotations. 
                        <ul><li>Remember, these must be entered in the csv <i>exactly</i> the way they are spelled here. (To El Nino, "Purple1" and "Purple 1" are 2 completely different rotations.)</li></ul></li></ul>
    <table></table></p>

<div class="output" id="outputLinks">
<p>This should have updated these main output files:

            <ul><li>Simple text output of errors this program encounter. Such errors occur when a resident has blanks in their schedule data, e.g., super-seniors have a bunch of blank blocks after they graduated. This file logs them for debugging.</li></ul></li></ul></p>    </div>
