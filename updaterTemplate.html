            <details><summary>How does El Nino work?</summary>
            <p>El Nino reads the messy schedule data on the Amion website and turns it into something only a robot could love - beautifully elaborate, machine-readable data on the entire residency program's schedule. This has some great uses:
                <ul><li>lunchMoney
                        <ul><li>Tally up how much cash to put on meal cards based on their rotation week-by-week.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>confAttend
                        <ul><li>Get the "denominator" for conference attendence. Count up how many conferences residents should have attended based on their block schedules.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>podSched
                        <ul><li>Getting multiple residents on different schedules in the same place at the same time is a pain!</li>
                            <li>podSched goes through an arbitrary subset of residents' schedules and outputs a ranked, scored list of dates when they are on the most aligned and convenient rotations.</li>
                            <li>For example, if you want to schedule an evening meeting, you can score for shifts that end around 5pm to pick an evening when everyone is available. (Hence the name - this was developed to schedule PLUS pod dinners.)</li>                           </ul></li></ul></p>
            <p>BUT, to do any of this, you need to make sure El Nino is working with an updated schedule. We all know the Amion schedule changes frequently. And that's why you are here.</p></details>

<h2>This is where you can update El Nino's database</h2>
<h3>Updates are big deal:</h3>
    <ul><li>El Nino reads the schedule from Amion and saves its own data.</li>
    <li>El Nino uses those data for its various functions.</li>
    <li>Of course, Amion changes all the time...</li>
    <li>So it's important to update El Nino before using it for critical tasks (e.g., assigning lunch money).</li></ul>

<h3>Block 1 Split Dates</h3>
    <p>El Nino can figure out most of the block schedule, but it needs you to set the "split dates" for block 1. You should only have to set this manually once a year in July.<br>
    Split dates are the Mondays when half blocks (eg JEOP | SFX) start. Because block 1 rarely starts on a Monday, el Nino needs you to tell it when to split block 1 (for both the R1 and R2/3 schedules).<br>

<div class="input" id="blockSplitForm">

<div class="prompt">Block 1 Split, R1: </div><input type="date" name="block1split1" min="2015-07-01" max="2050-06-30"><div class="currentSet">  Currently set to $block1split1</div><br>

If those current dates are still accurate, leave this blank and hit Submit to update the database.</p></div>
