<h3 class="title">This is where you can update El Nino's database</h2>
<p class="intro"><h3>Updates are big deal:</h3>
    <ul><li>El Nino reads the schedule from Amion and saves its own data.</li>
    <li>El Nino uses those data for its various functions.</li>
    <li>Of course, Amion changes all the time...</li>
    <li>So it's important to update El Nino before using it for critical tasks (e.g., assigning lunch money).</li></ul>

<h3>Block 1 Split Dates</h3>
    <p>El Nino can figure out most of the block schedule, but it needs you to set the "split dates" for block 1. You should only have to set this manually once a year in July.<br>
    Split dates are the Mondays when half blocks (eg JEOP | SFX) start. Because block 1 rarely starts on a Monday, el Nino needs you to tell it when to split block 1 (for both the R1 and R2/3 schedules).<br>
